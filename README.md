# Overview

I will write a program that interacts with a relational database using SQL. I will create a library database management system using SQL that will include at least one table to store data into, demonstrate the ability to insert, modify, delete,and retrieve data. The program I will create will write software that builds the SQL commans, submits them, recievges the results from the database, and uses the results in some way.
